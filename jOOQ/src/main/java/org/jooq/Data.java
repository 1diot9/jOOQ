/**
 * A type holding {@link #data()}, which is a {@link String} based
 * representation of a SQL data type with no reasonable representation in the
 * JDK or in JDBC.
 * <p>
 * JDBC maps most types to JDK types, but some vendor specific types lack an
 * equivalent in the JDK, or the relevant type is unsatisfactory (such as
 * {@link SQLXML}, which is a resource). To work around such limitations, jOOQ
 * establishes the set of {@link Data} types, with these properties:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>They contain a {@link NotNull} representation of their {@link #data()}.
 * In other words, a <code>CAST(NULL AS â€¦)</code> value is represented by a
 * <code>null</code> reference of type {@link Data}, not as
 * <code>data() == null</code>. This is consistent with jOOQ's general way of
 * returning <code>NULL</code> from {@link Result} and {@link Record}
 * methods.</li>
 * <li>They're {@link Serializable}</li>
 * <li>They may or may not use an internal, normalised representation of their
 * {@link #data()} for {@link #equals(Object)}, {@link #hashCode()}, and
 * {@link #toString()} (e.g. {@link JSONB})</li>
 * </ul>
